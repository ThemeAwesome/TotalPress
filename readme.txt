== Description ==

Hello world, I'm TotalPress! I'm Based off Underscores and I also come with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I am fully responsive, meaning I adjust seamlessly to any screen resolution so I look good on any device. There's Schema microdata built in for posts and pages, I've got 9 widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page templates. Did I mention hooks and filters? I got a ton of those. Another reason I'm awesome is I use the Kirki plugin. The Kirki plugin provides 30 custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. Kirki makes developing themes a lot faster and easier for developers and more meaningful for users. I also work really well with page builders like Elementor, Site Origin and many others. So what are you waiting for? Download me now and take me for a spin.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to use your new theme right away.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
- Question: Why do I need to install the Kirki Plugin
- Answer: The Kirki Plugin provides a set of customizer controls that were built using WordPress standards. Without the Kirki plugin, you will not have access to the TotalPress theme options in the customizer.
