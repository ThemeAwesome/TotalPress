== Description ==

My name is TotalPress! I'm based off _s (Underscores) and built with Zurb's Foundation for Sites, so I'm responsive and look good on any device. I'm light weight and super fast (I'm 185kb compressed). I have lots of hooks and filters, 10 widget areas and 6 different sidebar page templates. I use the Kirki plugin for the theme customizer and the Meta Box plugin for metaboxes. Did I mention that I work really well with page builders like Elementor? So what are you waiting for? Download me today and take me for a spin.

== Installation ==

Install theme from within WordPress

1. Visit `Appearance > Themes > Add New`.
2. Search for `TotalPress`.
3. Click the `Install Now` button to install the theme.
4. Click the `Activate` button to activate the theme.

Install theme manually

1. Unzip the download package.
2. Upload `totalpress` to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
3. Activate the theme through the `Themes` menu in WordPress.

Additional Installation

1. Once you have activated TotalPress, you will be promted to install the Kirki Plugin, as well as the the Meta-Box Plugin. You will see the following message: "This theme requires the following plugins: Kirki Plugin and Meta Box".
2. When you have installed and activated the Kirki Plugin, go to `Appearance > Customizer > TotalPress Options` and start customizing your site.
3. Once you have installed the Meta-Box plugin, you will see an additional metaboxes in the post/page editor.
4. If you do not install either one of these plugins, you will not see the `TotalPress Options` section in the customizer and you will not see the metaboxes in the post/page editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
- Question: Why do I need to install the Kirki Plugin?
- Answer: The Kirki Plugin provides a set of customizer controls that were built using WordPress standards. Without the Kirki plugin, you will not have access to the TotalPress theme options in the customizer.

- Question: Why do I need to install the Meta-Box Plugin?
- Answer: The Meta Box plugin creates the metaboxes you will see and use in the post/page editor.
