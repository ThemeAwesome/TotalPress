== Description ==

Hello world, I'm TotalPress! I'm Based off _s (Underscores) and I also come with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I am fully responsive, meaning I adjust seamlessly to any screen resolution so I look good on any device. I've got a ton of hooks and filters, I've got ten (10) widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page templates. I use the Kirki plugin. Kirki provides 30 custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. Kirki makes developing themes a lot faster and easier for developers and more meaningful for users. I also use the Meta Box plugin which is a powerful, professional toolkit for developers to create and handle everything related to custom meta boxes and custom fields for WordPress. I also work really well with page builders like Elementor. So what are you waiting for? Get to downloading and take me for a spin.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to `Appearance > Themes` and click the "Add New" button.
2. Use the Search or Filter options to locate the TotalPress theme or click `Upload Theme`, then click "Choose File", then select the TotalPress's ZIP file. Click Install Now.
3. Click Activate to start using Totalpress.
4. Once you have activated TotalPress, you will be promted by the TGM Plugin to install the Kirki Plugin, as well as the the Meta Box Plugin. You will be promted to do so with the following message: "This theme requires the following plugins: Kirki Plugin and Meta Box".
5. Keep in mind that if you do not install either one of these plugins, you will not be able to see the "Theme Options" section in the customizer nor will you will see the metaboxes in the post/page editor..
6. Once you have installed and activated the Kirki Plugin, go to `Appearance > Customizer > Theme Options` and start customizing your site.
7. Once you have installed the Meta Box plugin, you will see an additional metabox below the editor. This is a tabbed metabox called TotalPress Post/Page Options.

* Some of the code (a very small amount) used in TotalPress was derived from the GeneratePress theme created by Tom Usborne https://wordpress.org/themes/generatepress/ - GPLv2 or later, https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html - You created a very nice theme Tom. Thanks for the inspiration.
* Metaboxes were created using the "Meta Box PLugin" as well as the "Meta Box Builder" plugin extension, both from MetaBox.io. If you would like more inforamtion please visit the following: https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/ and https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/
* For the additional panels in the customizer I used the folowing gist: Extending WordPress Customizer Panels and Sections to allow nesting: pe-customize-controls.css, https://gist.github.com/OriginalEXE/9a6183e09f4cae2f30b006232bb154af created by OriginalEXE.
