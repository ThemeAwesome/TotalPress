== Description ==

Hello world, I'm TotalPress! I'm Based off Underscores and I also come with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I am fully responsive, meaning I adjust seamlessly to any screen resolution so I look good on any device. There's Schema microdata built in for posts and pages, I've got 9 widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page templates. Did I mention hooks and filters? I got a ton of those. Another reason I'm awesome is I use the Kirki plugin. The Kirki plugin provides 30 custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. Kirki makes developing themes a lot faster and easier for developers and more meaningful for users. I also work really well with page builders like Elementor, Site Origin and many others. So what are you waiting for? Download me now and take me for a spin.
