#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid ""
"Hello world, I'm TotalPress! I'm Based off _s (Underscores) and I also come "
"with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I "
"am fully responsive, meaning I adjust seamlessly to any screen resolution so "
"I look good on any device. There's Schema microdata built in for posts and "
"pages, I've got 9 widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page "
"templates. Did I mention hooks and filters? I got a ton of those. Another "
"reason I'm awesome is I use the Kirki plugin. The Kirki plugin provides 30 "
"custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders "
"and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. Kirki "
"makes developing themes a lot faster and easier for developers and more "
"meaningful for users. I also work really well with page builders like "
"Elementor, Site Origin and many others. So what are you waiting for? "
"Download me now and take me for a spin."
