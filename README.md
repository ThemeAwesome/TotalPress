TotalPress 1.0.2
====================

### Updated November 16, 2017

Hello world, I'm TotalPress! I'm Based off _s (Underscores) and I also come with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I am fully responsive, meaning I adjust seamlessly to any screen resolution so I look good on any device. There's Schema microdata built in for posts and pages, I've got 9 widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page templates. Did I mention hooks and filters? I got a ton of those. Another reason I'm awesome is I use the Kirki plugin. The Kirki plugin provides 30 custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. Kirki makes developing themes a lot faster and easier for developers and more meaningful for users. I also work really well with page builders like Elementor, Site Origin and many others. So what are you waiting for? Download me now and take me for a spin.

Features
=============

### Theme Customizer
WordPress introduced the [Theme Customizer](https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Customization_API) in 3.4. The customizer allows you to modify certain areas of a theme and preview those changes in real time before publishing. TotalPress utilizes this built in customizer and allows you to make changes to many areas of the theme.

### jQuery
TotalPress uses the version of jQuery bundled with WordPress and it is loaded in the header. This practice falls within the [WordPress Theme Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development). You can do a search and find the information you need to use Google's version and load it in the footer if you wish.

### Font-Awesome 4.7
Includes the free icon set [Font-Awesome](http://fontawesome.io)
