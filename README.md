Description
===
My name is TotalPress! I'm Based off _s (Underscores) and built with Zurb's Foundation for Sites, so I'm responsive and look good on any device. I'm light weight and super fast <strong>(250kb compressed!)</strong>. I have lots of hooks and filters, 10 widget areas and 6 different sidebar page templates. I use the Kirki plugin for the theme customizer and the Meta Box plugin for metaboxes. Did I mention that I work really well with page builders like Elementor and Header Footer Elementor. Download me today and take me for a spin.
