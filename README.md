Description
===
Hello world, meet TotalPress! I'm Based off _s (Underscores) and I also come with Zurb's Foundation for Sites fully integrated. What makes me awesome? I am small and fast (**I'm just 438kb compressed**). I am fully responsive, meaning I adjust to any screen resolution so I look good on any device. I've got a ton of hooks and filters, ten (10) widget areas built in as well as 6 different sidebar page templates. I use the Kirki plugin which provides 30 custom control types for the theme customizer ranging from simple sliders and tooltips to complex typography controls including Google-Fonts. I also use the Meta-Box plugin which is a powerful, professional toolkit for developers to create and handle everything related to custom meta boxes and custom fields for WordPress. Did I mention that I work really well with page builders like Elementor. So what are you waiting for? Download me today and take me for a spin.
